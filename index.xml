      <description>It’s the sixth week of my paternity leave. I recently became a twin dad in addition to being just a dad. Being off work and spending hours changing diapers and holding a baby or two offers a lot of time to think about stuff. I am a passionate Magic player and I haven’t been touching cards in the last few weeks, thus I found myself to be thinking about Magic a lot.</description>

      <description>Magic: the Gathering is a game bigger than its box. With over 10,000 individual cards Magic offers endless possibilities to play.
Using mathematical and statistical tools I try to find analytical solutions for imho interesting quantitative problems in and around the game. This blog won&amp;rsquo;t make you a better player but it will show you underappreciated puzzles within the world of Magic.
